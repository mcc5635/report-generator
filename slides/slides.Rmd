We often see these rmarkdown little wizard mixing Text & Code to produce document. Aim is to look deeper into this today. This is not so magic. It is juts perceived magic and there are tools to know about under the hood to be able to customize behavior further. And it is important to know about this for styling.

???

rmarkdown will run Pandoc & knitr for you so one input for multiple output possible. 
But stylings is specific to the output. 

This is important to know all this because it helps know where to look and what could be tweak. one has to understand what to tweak to make something works as expected.

# Styling with CSS

.subtitle[Cascading Stylesheets]

## What is CSS ?

.center-middle[
> While **HTML** is used to define the **structure and semantics** of your content, **CSS** is used to **style it and lay it out**.  
> For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

    Styling HTML output will require more or less CSS skills

]

???

If you have those skills, here what you can do

---

# Use CSS from inside a Rmd file

.subtitle[About the `css` chunk engine]

````markdown
```{css, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
/* add a blue border */
div.mybox {
  border-color: blue;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Set to blue bold text inside the box */
div.mybox strong {
  color: blue;
}
```
````

Applied directly in the Rmd document without an external css file 

???

Useful for prototyping, for quick iteration, for single file example
echo = false is important if you don't want to show CSS source chunk in output

You can also use the `css` argument of `html_document()`

But with CSS files it can be hard to create theme file you can reuse. 

Enter SASS

---
layout: true
# Use SASS the same way

.subtitle[About the `sass`/`scss` engine]

---

## What is SASS ?

Sass (https://sass-lang.com) is a CSS extension language that allows you to create CSS rules in much more flexible ways than you would do with plain CSS.
</br>
</br>
.center[![:scale 20%](https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg)]

It allows for variables, tweaking functions (called _mixins_), operations (like `/`), better CSS rule organisation (nesting, extensions, ...) and more.

???

**NEW WAY**

External tool used by web developers. Very powerful and this is a skill to learn when doing a lot of HTML. It can do a lot ! 

But no need to use it directly. Still need to learn the feature and syntax.

---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[previous css]

````markdown
```{css, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
div.mybox {
* border-color: blue;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-align: center;
}

div.mybox strong {
* color: blue;
}
```
````

]

.panel[.panel-name[scss]
````markdown
```{scss, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
*$color1: blue;

div {
  &.mybox {
*   border-color: $color1;
    border-style: solid;
    padding: 0.5em;
    text-align: center;

    strong {
*     color: $color1;
    }
  }
}
```
````
]
]

???

The CSS is the one that would be render when using sass on the .scss or .sass file. 

No preference on the syntax - it is a personnal choice (and depending on environment.)

.box[Support is now built-in **rmarkdown**]

]

???

Quite new. Allow to use SASS from R. Wrapper around a C library.

Supported in rmarkdown now.

---

External `.scss` file can also be passed in the `css` argument of most output format like `html_document()`

</br>

````yaml
output:
  html_document:
    css: custom-style.scss
````

.pb3[
The file will be processed internally by `sass::sass_file()` and produce a `.css` automatically.
]

.box[Using a `.scss` file makes it easier to use variables and rules in CSS.  
Use variables to store style guide values and use theme in several places.]

???

You can do much more with SASS. It pushes the limit of customization of a document.

You can easily apply style on component identified by class or id, attributes. 

HTML is the way to structure but Pandoc Markdown will simplify that.

# Apply custom style on specific component

.subtitle[Powered by Pandoc Markdown syntax]

Creating custom blocks (using Pandoc's Fenced Divs)

```{cat, opts.label ='cat_md'}
::: mybox
Special **important** content
:::
```

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.mybox-demo {
  border-color: blue;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0.5em;
  text-align: center;
}

.mybox-demo strong {
  color: blue;
}
```

.pb3[
With the previous style applied, it will result in this box in the document
]
.pb3[
.mybox-demo[
Special **important** content
]
]
```{r demo-box, echo = FALSE, results='asis', rm_temp = TRUE}
o <- tempfile()
rmarkdown::pandoc_convert(temp_file, to = "html", output = I(o))
content <- xfun::read_utf8(o)
unlink(o)
```

```{cat, engine.opts = list(lang = "html"), code = content}
```

???

Pandoc feature. R Markdown knows and extend it. 
Quite simple to write but quite powerful. 

Supported by Visual editor.

---

Using attributes on element works too (with Pandoc's Bracketed Spans)

```{cat, opts.label ='cat_md'}
[This is *some text*]{.my-bg-blue lang="en"}
```

Applying this style:

```{css, echo = TRUE}
.my-bg-blue {
  background: lightblue;
}
```

will result in: 

.my-bg-blue[This is *some text*]

```{r demo-span, echo = FALSE, results='asis', rm_temp = TRUE}
o <- tempfile()
rmarkdown::pandoc_convert(temp_file, to = "html", output = I(o))
content <- xfun::read_utf8(o)
unlink(o)
```



```{cat, engine.opts = list(lang = "html"), code = content}
```

# Going further with Bootstrap

Bootstrap is not for all outputs (xaringan, reveal, tufte, does not use for example)

We aim at making that even easier by creating a common theming system for all outputs where you could easily define vairables and rules and apply theme across output.

Using [Div & Spans](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) from Pandoc Markdown syntax.

.fl.w-50.pr5[
Using fenced div attributes

````markdown
::: {custom-style="highlight-box"}

Using Spans attributes  
for Text style:
```markdown
[One of the species lives on all islands]{custom-style="Emphatically"} and the others are specific to one island only. 
```

This will associate Docx Styles name to the text. Style can then be modified in template.
